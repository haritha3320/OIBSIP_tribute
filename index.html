        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. 
            He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film industry's most important figures. 
            His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977.
        <br> Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. 
        His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. 
        Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century" 
        in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work. </p>
